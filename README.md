INVENTORY MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS

Samsudeen Olawale Afolabi


PROJECT SCOPE:  The project's objective is to generate actionable insights aimed at enhancing inventory management practices, cutting costs, and elevating the overall customer experience by ensuring real-time product availability. The key focus areas include:



1) Optimizing Inventory Levels:

Provide recommendations for optimal inventory levels encompassing essential factors like reorder points and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).
EOQ will be determined to identify the ideal order quantity, minimizing overall inventory costs and mitigating the risk of stockouts.
Inventory Management Strategy:


2) Offer strategic recommendations for process improvements within the inventory management lifecycle:

Propose enhancements in procurement and production processes to increase operational efficiency.
Develop a comprehensive inventory management strategy to align with organizational goals, streamline processes, and enhance overall effectiveness.


By addressing these aspects, the project aims to foster efficient inventory management, reduce operational expenses, and ensure a seamless customer experience through consistent real-time product availability.







PROJECT STEPS: 

1)  Dataset Exploration, Cleaning, Wrangling, and EDA


Data Loading:


i)  Use Python (Pandas library) to load datasets (Purchase_prices, Beginning_inventory,End_inventory, Invoice_purchases, Purchases, Sales). Data Cleaning and Merging:


ii) Assess and clean redundant columns in each dataset.


iii) Drop redundant columns.


iv) Merge datasets based on common columns where applicable.


v) Handle missing values (NaN) in the merged datasets.



Data Wrangling:


i) Categorize variables into relevant types.


ii)  Define key metrics for inventory management.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):


i) Visualize key variables using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).


ii) Explore dispersion of key metrics.
